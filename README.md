NEWS
====
* We use CK technology to power [open and reproducible ACM ReQuEST tournaments](http://cKnowledge.org/request) on co-design of Pareto-efficient software/hardware stack for deep learning;
* We are building a [collective training set](http://cknowledge.org/repo/web.php?wcid=42b9a1221eb50259:collective_training_set) from user mispredictions and correct labels to improve models
* Our collaborative work with ARM was presented at [ARM TechCon'16 (Oct. 27)](http://schedule.armtechcon.com/session/know-your-workloads-design-more-efficient-systems);
* ARM uses CK as a front-end for systematic and reproducible benchmarking and tuning of real workloads: [link](https://github.com/ctuning/ck-wa); 
* Open challenges in computer engineering have been updated: [link](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Research-and-development-challenges);
* General Motors and dividiti shared CK workflow to crowdsource benchmarking and optimization of CAFFE (DNN framework) [here](https://github.com/dividiti/ck-caffe);
* We have moved related Open Science resources [here](http://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Enabling-Open-Science);

Introduction
============

This [CK-powered](http://github.com/ctuning/ck) open-source Android application 
lets the community participate in experiment crowdsourcing which require webcam
(such as crowd-benchmarking and crowd-tuning Caffe, Tensorflow 
and other DNN frameworks or any realistic application for image processing 
and recognition) using their mobile devices (mobile phones, tablets, IoT, etc)
and exchange knowledge via public CK servers.

You can download this app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=openscience.crowdsource.video.experiments). 

You can also find public results at [Live CK repo](http://cknowledge.org/repo)!

Public scenarios are prepared using this [CK GitHub repo](https://github.com/ctuning/ck-crowd-scenarios).
Caffe libraries are generated using [CK-Caffe framework](https://github.com/dividiti/ck-caffe).
Collective training set is available [here](http://cknowledge.org/repo/web.php?wcid=42b9a1221eb50259:collective_training_set).

Current scenarios include multi-dimensional and multi-objective
optimization of benchmarks and real workloads such as 
Caffe, TensorFlow and other DNN frameworks in terms
of performance, accuracy, energy, memory footprint, cost, etc.

Privacy Policy
==============

This application requires access to your Camera to let you
capture images, recognize them and collect various performance 
statistics. Note that, by default, no images are sent to public servers!
Only if misprediction happens, you are encouraged but not obliged (!)
to submit incorrectly recognized image with the correct label 
to the public server to help the community enhance existing
data sets with new images!
